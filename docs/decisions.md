# Decisions

Why the app is built the way it is. Things that were tried, rejected, or measured.

## Live view is MJPEG, not WebRTC as the default

Frigate's own docs make the argument: MSE is their default because it runs over
TCP and every frame arrives, while WebRTC drops late frames, which on cellular
shows up as frozen or corrupt video. An Android app cannot use MSE, so the
closest thing with the same guarantee is Frigate's JPEG stream on
`/api/<camera>`.

Rejected: WebRTC first, MJPEG as the fallback. It would have needed port 8555
forwarded before the app showed anything, and the failure mode is a black screen
that looks like a bug.

Open: a WebRTC toggle in the player. The server side is already prepared
(`webrtc.candidates: stun:8555` in the user's config), so it is only the client
that is missing.

## Live view goes through the existing HTTPS proxy

Measured on the user's setup: `/api/north_cam?h=720&fps=5` plays through Nginx
Proxy Manager and Cloudflare on mobile data. That means no second entry point
into the house, no extra DNS record, and nothing to configure in Cloudflare.

The cost is bandwidth, since every frame is a whole JPEG. The player offers 1080p
down to 480p and 2 to 15 frames a second, and the grid asks for 360p stills once
a second.

## OkHttp 4, not 5

OkHttp 5.5.1 requires compileSdk 37. This project is on AGP 8.12.0, which tops
out at 36. The API differences did not matter for four endpoints.

## No image loading library

Coil would be the usual choice. Instead `ImageCache` is an `LruCache` of decoded
bitmaps, filled by a coroutine, because the app also hand-writes the MJPEG frame
reader and the JPEG decode path either way. One less dependency and no version
guess.

## Polling stops when the app is not in front

The camera grid and the player run their loops inside
`repeatOnLifecycle(RESUMED)`. Without that, a grid of four cameras would keep
requesting a frame a second while the app sits in the background.

## Toolchain is pinned to the one on this machine

Gradle 8.13, AGP 8.12.0, Kotlin 2.2.10, compileSdk 36, and the Gradle daemon on
JDK 23 (set in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, not in the repo). The JDK this
machine has on `PATH` is newer than Gradle 8.13 supports.

## Package name

`nz.mckenzie.frigo`, matching the other Android project on this machine. The
repository is `cqrt/frigo`.
